Allowed functions: atoi, printf, write
---------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that will print all the solutions to the n queens
problem for a n sized chessboard.
We will not test your program with n < 1.
The order of the solutions is not important.

You will display the solutions under the following format:
One number per line: index of the queen in each column starting from 0.

For example this should work:
$> ./n_queens 4 | cat -e
1302$
2031$

Examples:
./n_queens 2 ->do nothing
./n_queen 4 -> 1 3 0 2
